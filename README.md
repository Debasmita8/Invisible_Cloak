"Invisible Clock Project: This project is inspired by Harry Potter's Invisible Cloak and utilizes the OpenCV Python library. It involves converting any red-colored cloth into the background color using an image processing technique called color detection and segmentation. For the cloth to become fully invisible, it must be of a single color, specifically red. When the camera opens, some time is needed to store the background. It's important for the background and the cloth to be of different colors for better results."
